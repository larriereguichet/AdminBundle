The Admin Bundle is an event based library. When an  admin route is called, an Admin objects based on the yaml defined 
configuration is build. The Admin object is responsible to dispatch events to handle forms, entities, persistence...

## How To Use
First, you need to create entities. The "simplest" way is to use Doctrine ORM entities. If you do not know how to use
Doctrine to create entities, read the [Symfony documentation](https://symfony.com/doc/current/doctrine.html). 

For the example, we  use a simple Article entity.
```php

namespace App\Entity;

class Article {
    private $id;
    private $ntitle;
    private $content;
    private $date;
    private $isPublished;
    
    // Getters and setters...
}
```

To have a CRUD to manage our articles, we need to add some configuration:
```yaml
    // config/packages/lag_admin.yaml
    
    lag_admin:
        admins:
            # The admin name can be anything, but it should be unique
            article:
                # The fully qualified path to the entity
                entity: App\Entity\Article
                actions:
                    create: ~
                    edit: ~
                    list: ~
                    delete: ~
```
This is the basic configuration to have CRUD views (create/retrieve/update/delete).
```
    Note : as some routes has been generated, you may need to clear the cache to see the modifications.
    USe the follwoing command to clear the cache "bin/console cache:clear"
```

At this point, you can go to the url `/admin/articles` to see a paginated list of your articles. By default, the `id`
column has a link to go to the edit form of each article. As the `create` action is enabled, a `Create` button is 
displayed to the top menu. As the `delete` action is enabled, a `Delete` button is displayed at the end of each row.



## Admin
An Admin is an object responsible to load the required data for the current action. When an Admin url is called, the 
Admin factory create an Admin according the route configuration and the Admin configuration.

Then the Admin handle the request and execute several actions to gather data to display the wanted view.

The Admin can be configured to customize some parameters:
```yaml
    // config/packages/lag_admin.yaml
    
    lag_admin:
        admins:
            # The admin name can be anything, but it should be unique. All the following configuration values are only 
            # applied to the current Admin. It overrides the values of Application configuration parameters. Those values 
            # are the default values
            article:
                # The fully qualified path to the entity. If you use the Doctrine ORM data provider, this class should 
                # be a Doctrine entity 
                entity: App\Entity\Article
                # Those are the default actions. You can remove or add your own action.
                actions:
                    create: ~
                    edit: ~
                    list: ~
                    delete: ~
                # You can use your own Admin class here. It should implements LAG\AdminBundle\Admin\AdminInterface
                class: LAG\AdminBundle\Admin\Admin 
                
                # You can customize the route names and urls generated. It should contains "{admin}" and "{action}"
                routing_name_pattern: lag.admin.{admin}.{action}
                routing_url_pattern: /{admin}/{action}
                
                # You can override the default controller. Be careful, the bundle should not work as expected if your
                # custom controller does trigger required events 
                controller: LAG\AdminBundle\Controller\AdminAction
                
                # The maximum number of entities displayed in the list Action 
                max_per_page: 20
                
                # Use the translation system. The translation pattern are used to generate the translation keys. It 
                # should contains the {key}
                translation: false
                translation_pattern: lag.admin.{key}
                
                # Documentation in progress
                form: ~
                form_options: ~
                pager: ~
                permissions: ~
                string_length: ~
                string_length_truncate: ~
                date_format: ~
                data_provider: ~
                page_parameter: ~
                list_template: ~
                edit_template: ~
                create_template: ~
                delete_template:  ~

```

## Actions
Actions are created when the `AdminEvents::HANDLE_REQUEST` is dispatched. 

```yaml
    // config/packages/lag_admin.yaml
    
    lag_admin:
        admins:
            article:                 
                entity: App\Entity\Article
                # The default CRUD Actions are create, edit, remove and list. You can remove the action you do not want.
                # You can also add your custom Actions, see the documentation. This is the default configuration values.
                # This override the Admin configuration and the Application configuration
                actions:
                    create:
                        title: lag.admin.article.create
                        class: LAG\AdminBundle\Admin\Action
                        fields: []
                        permissions: ROLE_ADMIN
                        export: []
                        order: []
                        route: ~
                        route_parameters: []
                        route_path: ~
                        route_requirements: []
                        route_defaults':
                            _controller: LAG\AdminBundle\Admin\Admin
                        icon: null
                        load_strategy: none
                        pager: false
                        page_parameter: page
                        max_per_page: ~
                        criteria: []
                        filters: []
                        menus: []
                        template: ~
                        sortable: ~
                        string_length: ~
                        string_length_truncate: ~
                        date_format: ~
                        use_form: ~
                        form: null
                    edit: ~
                    list: ~
                    delete: ~
