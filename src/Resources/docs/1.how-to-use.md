The Admin Bundle is an event based library. When an  admin route is called, an Admin objects based on the yaml defined 
configuration is build. The Admin object is responsible to dispatch events to handle forms, entities, persistence...

## How To Use
First, you need to create entities. The easiest way is to use Doctrine ORM entities. If you do not know how to use
Doctrine to create entities, read the [Symfony documentation](https://symfony.com/doc/current/doctrine.html). 

For the example, we  use a simple Article entity.
```php

namespace App\Entity;

class Article {
    private $id;
    private $ntitle;
    private $content;
    private $date;
    private $isPublished;
    
    // Getters and setters...
}
```

To have a CRUD to manage our articles, we need to add some configuration:
```yaml
// config/packages/lag_admin.yaml

lag_admin:
    admins:
        # The admin name can be anything, but it should be unique
        article:
            # The fully qualified path to the entity
            entity: App\Entity\Article
            actions:
                create: ~
                edit: ~
                list: ~
                delete: ~
```
This is the basic configuration to have CRUD views (create/retrieve/update/delete).
```
    Note : as some routes has been generated, you may need to clear the cache to see the modifications.
    USe the follwoing command to clear the cache "bin/console cache:clear"
```

At this point, you can go to the url `/admin/articles` to see a paginated list of your articles. By default, the `id`
column has a link to go to the edit form of each article. As the `create` action is enabled, a `Create` button is 
displayed to the top menu. As the `delete` action is enabled, a `Delete` button is displayed at the end of each row.


## Admin
An Admin is an object responsible to load the required data for the current action. When an Admin url is called, the 
Admin factory create an Admin according the route configuration and the Admin configuration.

Then the Admin handle the request and execute several actions to gather data to display the wanted view.

The Admin can be configured to customize some parameters:
```yaml
// config/packages/lag_admin.yaml

lag_admin:
    admins:
        # The admin name can be anything, but it should be unique. All the following configuration values are only 
        # applied to the current Admin. It overrides the values of Application configuration parameters. Those values 
        # are the default values
        article:
            # The fully qualified path to the entity. If you use the Doctrine ORM data provider, this class should 
            # be a Doctrine entity 
            entity: App\Entity\Article
            # Those are the default actions. You can remove or add your own action.
            actions:
                create: ~
                edit: ~
                list: ~
                delete: ~
            # You can use your own Admin class here. It should implements LAG\AdminBundle\Admin\AdminInterface
            class: LAG\AdminBundle\Admin\Admin 
            
            # You can customize the route names and urls generated. It should contains "{admin}" and "{action}"
            routing_name_pattern: lag.admin.{admin}.{action}
            routing_url_pattern: /{admin}/{action}
            
            # You can override the default controller. Be careful, the bundle should not work as expected if your
            # custom controller does trigger required events 
            controller: LAG\AdminBundle\Controller\AdminAction
            
            # The maximum number of entities displayed in the list Action 
            max_per_page: 20
            
            # Use the translation system. The translation pattern are used to generate the translation keys. It 
            # should contains the {key}
            translation: false
            translation_pattern: lag.admin.{key}
            
            # Documentation in progress
            form: ~
            form_options: ~
            pager: ~
            permissions: ~
            string_length: ~
            string_length_truncate: ~
            date_format: ~
            data_provider: ~
                page_parameter: ~
                list_template: ~
                edit_template: ~
                create_template: ~
                delete_template:  ~

```

Each admin should define actions for the configured entity. Defaults actions are the CRUD actions : create, edit, list 
and delete.

## Actions
Actions are created when the `AdminEvents::HANDLE_REQUEST` is dispatched, according to the configuration of the current
found admin. Each actions defined fields and parameters to build a view.

The configuration reference for an action is :
```yaml
// config/packages/lag_admin.yaml

lag_admin:
    admins:
        article:                 
            entity: App\Entity\Article
            # The default CRUD Actions are create, edit, remove and list. You can remove the action you do not want.
            # You can also add your custom Actions, see the documentation. This is the default configuration values.
            # This override the Admin configuration and the Application configuration
            actions:
                create: ~
                edit: ~
                list: ~
                delete: ~

```


By default, the `AdminBundle` defines the following actions :

### Create action

This action is used to display the create form of the configured entity in the parent `Admin`.
You can define the following options for the `create` actions :

```yaml
lag_admin:
    admins:
        article:
            entity:
            actions:
                create:
                    title: lag.admin.article.create
                    icon: null      
                    template: ~                    
                    form: null
                    fields: []
                    permissions: ROLE_ADMIN
                    route: ~
                    route_parameters: []
                    route_path: ~
                    route_requirements: []
                    route_defaults':
                        _controller: LAG\AdminBundle\Admin\Admin
                    class: LAG\AdminBundle\Admin\Action
                    load_strategy: none
```

| Options  | Defaults | Notes |
| ------------- | ------------- | ------------- |
| title  | `lag.admin.article.create`  | This is the title use in the view (html title and h1 title)  |
| template | `null` | The twig template used to display the action view |
| form | `null` | The form class used to create the new entity  |
| icon | `null` | The icon display in the h1 title |
| fields | `[]` | An array of fields mapping. The key is the name of the field and the value is the field configuration. You can learn more about fields in the "Fields" section. Note that this mapping has no effect if a form class is provided|
| permissions | `ROLE_ADMIN` | The required role to granted for this action |
| route | `null` | The route used for this action |
| route_parameters | `[]` | The route parameters used for this action |
| route_path | `[]` | The route path used for this action |
| route_defaults | `[]` | The route defaults used for this action |
| icon | `null` | The icon display in the h1 title |
| load_strategy | `none` | This option should be to none in the create action, as no entity should be loaded from the database |
| class  | `LAG\AdminBundle\Admin\Action` | The action class which will be instantiated. In most of case; you do not need to change this option  |

### Update action

This action is used to display the update form of the configured entity in the parent `Admin`.
You can define the following options for the `update` actions :

```yaml
lag_admin:
    admins:
        article:
            entity:
            actions:
                create:
                    title: lag.admin.article.create
                    icon: null      
                    template: ~                    
                    form: null
                    fields: []
                    permissions: ROLE_ADMIN
                    route: ~
                    route_parameters: []

                    route_defaults':
                        _controller: LAG\AdminBundle\Admin\Admin
                    class: LAG\AdminBundle\Admin\Action
