# Introduction

AdminBundle allows you to create flexible and robust backoffice, using a simple yml configuration,
for your Symfony application.

The configuration syntax is familiar with symfony1 generators.yml syntax and it is quite easy to manipulate. AdminBundle
does not generate code, it uses an generic controller to build CRUD actions. You can use custom your actions alongside
generic AdminBundle's actions. 

You can also override the configuration dynamically via events. Or use your custom controller for a particular entity.
AdminBundle comes with translation management (fields, column names...) and with built-in bootstrap integration. You
can disable this functionality to use your own html integration. 

## Features

- CRUD interface for Doctrine entities
- Translation management

## Installation

in progress...

## How it's work !

AdminBundle will read your configuration to create an Admin object for each of your entities. For each action, an object
Action containing Field object will describe your admin user interface. Each action has a symfony route (dynamically added).

Admin, Action and Field object are built with factories services which can be override. For create and edit action, a
form will be created according to the options form in admin configuration.
